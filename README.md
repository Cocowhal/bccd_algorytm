## BCCD_BOT
This AI project uses:
* YOLOv5 by ultraluticks - https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5
* ROBOFLOW - https://app.roboflow.com/
* The bccd dataset - https://github.com/Shenggan/BCCD_Dataset (the version used is was taken from ROBOFLOW)

This is a simple AI project that uses the YOLOv5 model to train an algorithm to locate and identify different blood cells. The images used to train and test the algorithm is taken from the BCCD dataset.
